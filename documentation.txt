*** APP CREATION
local APP = {}

-- Name that appears on the home screen
APP.PrintName = "App Name"
-- Path to the icon, relative to materials directory
APP.Icon = "vgui/gphone/app_image.png"
-- (optional) Gamemode in which this app can be run, only use if the app has gamemode-specific functions or variables
APP.Gamemode = "DarkRP"

function APP.Run( objects, screen )
	-- Called when your App opens
	
	-- The status bar is white by default which might not appear on some colors, you can darken it with this function
	-- gPhone.DarkenStatusBar()
	
	-- 'screen' is gPhone.phoneScreen, its easier to write this way
	
	-- 'objects' is the table in which all app-related screen elements are stored
	-- Create your parent panels in the table.
	--[[ ex:
		objects.Panel = vgui.Create("DPanel")
		
		local button = vgui.Create("DButton", objects.Panel)
	]]
	
end

-- You can create your own functions and reference them in the default APP functions
-- Its just for neatness and the existance of custom functions is entirely optional
-- function APP.YourCustomFunction( args ) print(args) end
-- APP.YourCustomFunction( 24 )

function APP.Paint( screen )
	-- Called when the screen's Paint function is called
	
	-- This overrides it so you will have to draw your own background, example below
	-- draw.RoundedBox(2, 0, 0, screen:GetTall(), Color(0, 0, 0))
	-- Don't put any Derma in here
end

-- Adds the app to the phone
